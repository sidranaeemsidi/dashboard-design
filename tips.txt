While using a prepros
always use the current projects SCSS folder 
as it is currently having the previous prject's SCSS folder we have to remove it from the Prepros and open the Dashboards 
SASS folder to compile.

(!Warning: when you copy paste a project and it has SCSS folder the compiler have this prepros config file which
uses the path of that project so we have to delete that file AS WELL AS reset the path of this project's theme.scss)

(INFO: Prepros is a good software and it always tells you whenever you have a missing css syntax and it shows failed
let me show you by creating an error)


A Dashboard should never have a scroll bar only scoll bar inside the displayBox 
side bar should be fixed / sticky and steady so we will subtract the padding we gave 

i was just thinking of removing the padding from the parent alphaBox but it is good i should show you 
some experience where the scrollbar shows up and how to get rid of it so let me show you

Very next of the .abc will go red coz we used .abc + a {} so very next sibling<a> after abc will go red

Layout smjh a gya

Ye banao
